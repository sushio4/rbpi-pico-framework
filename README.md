# rbpi-pico-framework
Simple framework for handling graphics and keyboard

# Hardware
You need a 48x84 screen with serial input as well as any keyboard matrix (buttons connected by rows and columns)

# Future
I'd like to add task management and loading executable files from data storage, maybe something OS-like. But now I can play snake with this :D
